#Requirements 

1.Digispark ATtiny-85 usb development board
2.Arduino IDE 
3.<Digikeyboard.h> library for the board.
4. C programming
5 A victim with LInux distro

I have provided the Arduino IDE code , its written in C language which can be uploaded onto the bad usb board by writing the code in IDE and then uploading it. The code will setup a reverse python shell for backdoor access to the linux machine on which the ATtiny USB is attached. Here I am opening the terminal with ALT+CTRL+T , you can specify your own commands and delay as well.
